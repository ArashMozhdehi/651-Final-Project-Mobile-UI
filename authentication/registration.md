# Registration

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** The registration page with nice Day and Night animation provide a nice UI for the user to register an account in the system using the back-end server powered by Flask.
{% endhint %}

The registration page asks the user to enter his/her first name, last name and weight, as well as a username and password combination for the secure access in the future. The application checks whether the user already exists if so an error will be prompted. For providing the user with a great user experience upon the successful registration the user will be redirected to login page and the user field will be filled with the username for convenient login.
