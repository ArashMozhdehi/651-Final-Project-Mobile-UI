# Login

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** This login page has an nice Day and Night animation as well as an animation that moves the text-boxes and button from outside of the page to the middle.
{% endhint %}

This login page allows secure login to the system and receives the Token from the back-end and stores it in the internal DB to be used in future for secure communication between the flask-based back-end and this Mobile UI.
