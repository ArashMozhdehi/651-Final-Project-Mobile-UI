# Finding bike friendly destinations

Through a user friendly interface the use can pick a bike-friendly destination (a historical place, an event in the city of Calgary, a bike park, or a parking lot for bikes). The user can pick a place through reviewing those places' descriptions, as well as reading the other user's reviews and feedbacks. This user-friendly interface shows the best cycling route to the destination and show the route to the user. It also protects the users by providing them with the notifications about the construction sites and live traffic incidents in the city of Calgary 100m ahead. The UI also provide the user about his/her travelling speed.
